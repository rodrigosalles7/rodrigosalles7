# Hi, I'm Rodrigo! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a passionate QA Engineer with over 4 years of experience in manual, automated, and performance testing, helping teams build and deliver reliable, fast, and scalable software across web, mobile, and desktop platforms.

Throughout my journey, Iâ€™ve developed strong technical skills using tools like Cypress, Playwright, Postman, K6, and programming languages such as JavaScript and TypeScript. I create and maintain end-to-end, API, and performance tests, and integrate them into CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions, Jenkins, and Azure DevOps, ensuring that testing is part of the development lifecycle from the very beginning.

Currently, I work as a QA Manager, where I lead test strategy, automation, and quality initiatives across multiple teams. My work is not limited to finding bugs â€” Iâ€™m constantly thinking about how to improve the product, prevent defects, and make testing more intelligent and efficient. I apply Shift-Left Testing, Risk-Based Testing, and performance analysis to make sure weâ€™re not only testing, but truly building quality into every stage of development.

I actively collaborate with developers, designers, DevOps engineers, and product managers in agile environments, promoting a culture where quality is a shared responsibility. I mentor other QA professionals, lead best practices, and bring insights that connect testing with business goals. I also contribute to process improvements, automation frameworks, and metrics that support decision-making.

My passion goes beyond traditional testing â€” Iâ€™m highly interested in Artificial Intelligence and how it can enhance QA through smart automation, predictive analysis, and AI-driven test generation. Iâ€™m always exploring new tools, technologies, and methodologies to keep evolving and helping my team deliver with speed and confidence.

Certified in CTFL, I believe that quality is not just about testing software, but about creating value, trust, and great user experiences. My mission is to make sure that every product I work on is not only functional, but robust, scalable, and ready for real-world usage.
